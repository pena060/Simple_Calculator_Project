# Simple_Calculator_Project
This is a simple calculator created using C++, and a CLR project, used to target the . NET platform. This allowed me to create a simple clickable UI for this calculator. 


Overview:
 This calculator allows you to perform various arithmetic operation (+-*/) on 2 numbers (int or double) and displays the result in the UI.
 
 How it works:
 - click on the 2 textboxes and type a number on each
 - then click on the button of the type of arithmetic operation you would like to do
 - finally, press the '=' to get the result of the operation
 - you can modify the numbers typed inside the textboxes at anytime


ENJOY!
